# How Do Humans Access the Credibility of Weblogs:Qualifying and Verifying Human Factors withMachine Learning

The purpose of this paper is to understand the factors in-volved when a human judges the credibility of informationand to develop a classification model for weblogs, a primarysource of information for many people. Considering bothcomputational and human-centered approaches, we con-ducted a user study designed to consider two cognitive proce-dures−(1) visceral, behavioral and (2) reflective assessmentsin the evaluation of information credibility. The results of the80study highlight that human cognitive processing variesaccording to an individual person's purpose and that humansconsider the structures and styles of content in their reflec-tive assessments. We experimentally proved these findingsthrough the development and analysis of classification mod-els using 16,304 real blog posts written by 2,944 bloggers. Ourmodels yield greater accuracy (88.2%) and efficiency (fewerdimensions) than the models with well-known best featuresidentified in prior research.
